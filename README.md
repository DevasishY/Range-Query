# Range Query
Range Query problems are very interesting problems to learn.</br>
Generally Query problems are two types : </br>
* offline</br>
* online</br>

In solving Range query Problems with given range(L,R) and queries(Q) time-complexity will be O(N.Q) where N represents length of range and Q represents number of queries.</br>

Comming to difference between offline and online Range Queries problems is that in offline range query problems we are given all queries before hand while in online we do not know what is the next query.

Here we gonna discuss about the offline queries using following methods:
* Prefix Sum
* Square Root Decomposition
* Mo's Algorithm
* Sparse Table
